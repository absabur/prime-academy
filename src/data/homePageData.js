    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
    making it look like readable English. Many desktop applications use it as a placeholder.
